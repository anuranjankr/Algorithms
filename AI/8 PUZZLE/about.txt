The 8-puzzle is a sliding tile puzzle that is made up of a square structured frame area containing 9 tiles in random/irregular order with one tile missing. The 8-puzzle problem is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s.
It is a smaller version of the 15-puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen, Mystic Square and numerous other names). 8-puzzle is basically a frame area separated into 3x3 grids containing 8 tiles and one void grid. The tiles are marked in some way so as they can be identified. The tiles are mostly numbered from 1 to 8. We are given with an initial configuration of the tiles. A desired final configuration is also given. We have to reach the final state by sliding the tiles in either vertically or horizontally using the empty grid present. Diagonally swapping is not allowed.
